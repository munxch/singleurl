00:00 Joshua Munsch: Hey, what's going on?
00:01 Mario Elysian: you, oh, Not much. How are you? I guess lots. But I always say that.
00:08 Joshua Munsch: Not too bad. I'm glad it's Friday. That's for sure.
00:11 Mario Elysian: Yeah, happy Friday. Let me just get everything set up here so Yeah, so I guess maybe a few small things so we can chat about before we kind of dive into all this. I, Yeah, maybe one of our founders is still our shoe, how might might join in a little bit, but you and I can kind of just jam on things and we can always show them what happened later.
00:41 Mario Elysian: Yeah, I mentioned like Yeah we'd love to figure out how to compensate you for your time so I'm not sure what exactly sounds.
00:49 Joshua Munsch: Hi, I'm transcribing this call with my Tactiq AI Extension: https://tactiq.io/r/transcribing
00:55 Mario Elysian: A specifically fair but I think we can you know maybe do something like an hourly or something like that and you can just send us an invoice and we'll we can take care of it.
01:06 Joshua Munsch: Cool. I was curious. Are you thinking? And I'm, I wouldn't either, but, like, are we just doing, like, kind of the time we have slotted here, or with their potentially be like some after hour, not after hours, but, like, kind of after this meeting, A little bit of work. I'm down for either. I'm just curious.
01:24 Mario Elysian: Yeah, I mean I think I'm I mean we can chat through this now and I'm very curious to see like, you know, how you would consider extending it. Or if you feel like you want to kind of run with a little bit, I think kind of the, the types of things I'm trying to look for are like kind of, you know, I guess you could say like, from like an agency perspective like How much you feel like you can take on and kind of, you know, drive the like kind of the solution or the prototype or, or what you're looking for. And if you need a little bit more time, that's okay. I mean, I think, I think it's like, you know, you should we
02:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
02:02 Mario Elysian: should definitely like use some of the time to like kind of at least answer some questions and we can also use that use the time to also You know, understand a little bit about how tiny fish works and things like that. So you know, like kind of how to leverage it the best. So, you know, I think it's probably, you know, I think the time here is probably like a little bit of both and also curious to hear your your feedback on that like what you think about it and like do you think that that is something like it's a good position or you know if you have any thoughts on like how it could be better positioned or It by people, like I think all those things will go into kind of what we're going to.
02:41 Mario Elysian: Kind of jam on a little bit.
02:45 Joshua Munsch: Awesome.
02:46 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
02:47 Joshua Munsch: No, it sounds good.
02:49 Mario Elysian: I guess for like the invoice or I guess, are you okay with I chatted with our operations people are you okay with doing kind of somewhere, like 180 an hour right now for for this type of thing and then? Okay. Yeah. I
03:06 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
03:09 Mario Elysian: don't think we'll, you know, we can probably put a cap on it somewhere around like, you know, for four or six hours, like I don't want you to think of this as like, I mean, if you feel like really compelled to make it like a weekend project or something like that, by all means, like let's discuss but I, I'm not
03:25 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
03:26 Mario Elysian: yeah, I don't want this to become like something that just like takes over as much as just like, you know, something that kind of find some common ground to, to talk about, okay? Yeah. So Maybe before we get started though. I mean, maybe, like, since we last chatted do you have any kind of thoughts or questions or anything? You want to kind of kick things off with to kind of
03:55 Joshua Munsch: so,
03:55 Mario Elysian: You know. Get your your grounding a little bit more understood.
04:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. yeah, I mean Sorry, good.
04:04 Mario Elysian: Go ahead. Yeah, it's just going to say, I don't really have. Yeah, I otherwise, I can kind of start by showing you a few things as well, but I'll let you go first.
04:15 Joshua Munsch: no, I mean I think Main questions are just like, Yeah, with the onboarding I'm super Excited to I think had a dig into a little bit more of like, obviously, what the experience is kind of talk about customers. I think like the Wii reference you shared super inspiring. So definitely want to anchor in on that and just kind of
04:36 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
04:38 Joshua Munsch: and I think through some of those details as we as I understand a little bit better, but no, like real questions, I think it's mainly like Yeah, starting to dig into what's currently there. So I can kind of grasp around like what you know, that really like kind of magic moment is and then kind of work backwards from there. So
04:55 Mario Elysian: yeah, I think I think, Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up again because I, I think that one of the things that, like, for example, like our CEO and I talk about is, is this realm of like, There is a lot of things that like SAS products do. That are all very similar. Like for example, you know,
05:18 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
05:21 Mario Elysian: Yeah, I mean we can pick any product and they generally kind of have similar patterns. I mean some patterns are required. Some are you know, more standardized and I think we You know, if we want to go under this guys of of being a new core interaction on the Internet like I saw the last time we were chatting, you use like the diabrowser idea which, you know, the browser company. I think also takes a bit of a fresh take on, you know, rethinking like how you use the core interactions of using a browser. But if we were to take that up even one more level of thinking about that as like, what are like the core interactions of the Internet, you know, the the way the Tiny Fish works is that we have this like very core technology which is the I guess we'll call it. Like the Tetra browser is what we currently call it like the Tetra fish but it's a it's a completely scalable browser system. Like it's a cloud browser and it's a bunch of machines.
06:31 Mario Elysian: We have in a data center that can Run jobs in parallel and has the ability to kind of, you know, extract the information. It needs through actually a variety of methods, not just, like, by opening up a browser sometimes it we have multiple kind of layers of like Can we understand like even just by pinging, the network traffic, can we dump all the API data and and just like like see if there's an API and instead of like trying to load the entire web page, we'll just go ping the API for the answer, you
07:10 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, interesting.
07:10 Mario Elysian: know? So so there are kind of like, you know, when it's like, It's not even about being just like a browser company. It's more like a where, an Internet Yeah, service. Really? It's it's like the the core things that exist on the the Internet. So you know many many companies offer just like very very Straightforward apis. They're in easily discoverable. You know? Like, I think meetup.com is one that actually you can, like, literally just like, go on the page and like you can actually just see that it's an API that's loading all the results and it's like, Well, why why spend the time rendering the Web page just
07:48 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
07:53 Mario Elysian: go talk to the API. It's open. So you know, we have all these roots and You know, I guess, maybe I'll kind of like work work my way up the stack because I think that it's kind of like, if you think about that core thing, it's not even about, like, teaching somebody that it's a browser that works and does this thing. It's not really like Atlas or Diabrowser or, you know, the perplexity comment it's like you know those are all
08:25 Joshua Munsch: that's for, like,
08:25 Mario Elysian: kind of like it has to like utilize like the browser frame and like talk to it and do all these things like did it's not always like that. And then on top of that, we have kind of two other solutions that I guess we run the system through one is called. I guess we call it the memory bank right now. We don't really have a better word for it, but it's it's an optimization service that like looks at.
08:53 Mario Elysian: For example, if you have an API where you're like trying to ping data off of a website, like even like the use cases that we're We show like on the video of like, You know, How Do I Get Like the shipping Info from USPS? It's like, Well, the site doesn't change that often. So we take the like understanding of the site and we codify that so that we don't have to even if we have to like, load the browser, it's like, Oh well we don't we have like the complete map of like how to figure out what to do on that that page. It's like Oh, you know, click on this this text box.
09:31 Mario Elysian: Or the thing, click this button to submit it, you know, you'll have to wait a
09:36 Mario Elysian: second for it to calculate and then you'll get a table but even by like saying that it's like, oh it now can kind of trim and like, you know, look for the right data much much faster. So it's like giving it a little bit of a guide and it
09:54 Joshua Munsch: every site or I guess how does like it's basically a stored kind of familiarity with how to interact on that website or what to
10:02 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah, right now we're doing it for every website. We see. So if we load it, we at least take a record of it and we kind of do a little bit of post-processing after of, like, kind of like what, what went right what went wrong, did it. Sometimes it times out, Sometimes it's like a customer gives us like a whole table of websites and I mean, many of them are like dead deadlinks, or they're
10:27 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
10:28 Mario Elysian: they don't work. So we document all those as well to kind of speed things up.
10:33 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
10:36 Mario Elysian: And then, we have another one that we've been working on with kind of a, I guess, you could say, it's a lightweight kind of partnership with with Microsoft right now and they have this technology called NL Web, which I think sedition has talked briefly talked about. Let me let me show my screen real quick. Which is a kind of a, It's a semantic search technology that Microsoft's actually open sourcing and we've been discussing kind of an integration with them for the past.
11:16 Mario Elysian: Few months and this is, this is the project. You can just type in NL Web - AI But if you kind of like scroll through to they get up project, it kind of talks a little bit about like it's kind of an open source tool that Microsoft is working on to, basically, like kind of expand like, the idea of like, there's currently like, centralized search like there's being the Microsoft owns and, and Google for the most part, but there isn't really like a way to like find information on the Internet and like understand like who's the authority like outside of these two sources, really it's like open AI actually, when you search for something on open AI or on chat tpt it actually pings being because of the Microsoft partnership, they have for search results and then it starts looking even if you use Atlas or something like that, I forget what Claude is I think they use like x ai or some some other service similar to this. So you know kind of one. Yeah. Another aspect of the stack that Starting to build on is actually building our own semantic, search as well that allows us to not just like collect the data, which is kind of the traditional indexing, but the semantic one is like you can ask all sorts of questions and almost just like Keep this very, very lightweight as a map. It's kind of like another big map of the Internet of like Well if you're looking for a restaurant and you type it into an LM, it will guess it's based on its training. It's like, Oh yeah, Yelp is probably a good place. Google Maps is probably a good place,
12:57 Joshua Munsch: Hmm.
12:57 Mario Elysian: but the NL Web system is actually very interconnected. It's it has like we have our own version. That we host. And there are many other companies that are starting to work with, with Microsoft on this, like, one is, for example TripAdvisor. Another one is shopify. I believe. So they're out. They're also maintaining their own indexes of the sites within their own company, which is what most most companies use it for, but we're actually using it almost as like a meta level or just collecting all the information. But when you ping this system, it can say like, Oh I'm looking for. Like you can tell it in natural language. Like I want to know who makes handmade, You know, you know, Indigo napkins, Japanese style, napkins, or something like that.
13:55 Mario Elysian: And it will probably go through the shopify thing and it'll be like well, the first layer is like who's an authority on on being able to provide like handmade gifts. It's probably shopify and then it'll go ping. The shopify system for like show me a few results of these things and it'll return to results. And all of
14:13 Joshua Munsch: Hmm.
14:13 Mario Elysian: this is kind of becoming a free-ish service. That Microsoft, is trying to to push out as like an alternative for agents to use like, yeah, so it's
14:26 Joshua Munsch: Got it. The alternative on. That would be like. I searched that whether it's retract GPT or on like Google or being that would
14:33 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Right.
14:38 Joshua Munsch: I guess. Yeah then what would be the difference on the Google search? It's like I guess. What's ranked or what's promoted like
14:45 Mario Elysian: Yeah, exactly. Like Google searches are pretty tainted with sponsored results. Etc. Just like you mentioned, there's also kind of the pending question of like, I think, you know, I don't think chat GPT is allowed to search Google, I think Google blocks them. So it's also like,
15:03 Joshua Munsch: Mmm.
15:05 Mario Elysian: Like, you know, because chat GPT doesn't listen to the same like, advertising tactics that humans, listen to, it's not going to like click on the ad as your first result, it's gonna try and find like a peer result. So there is some of that that I think if you, if you think about like the fundamentals of search, it's becoming a little bit more. Interesting where it's like, Microsoft starting to investigate this like. Well,
15:31 Joshua Munsch: You know.
15:33 Mario Elysian: if nobody wants to go to Google anymore or Google doesn't allow anybody to go there, like How can the Internet kind of just talk amongst each other to help,
15:43 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
15:44 Mario Elysian: help people find information. So, that's another layer that we're, we're
15:46 Joshua Munsch: Understand.
15:50 Mario Elysian: starting to just extend with all the stuff that we're working on with all of our customers. We're kind of scrubbing all their data of like any private information. And we're loading it into our our system. So that's like Oh if you're looking for like concert tickets in Chicago, next month, we can actually give you a pretty complete list within under a second. And you know, there's definitely like kind of the question of like well we also just give you like the timestamp of like the last time we collected this information and you can decide whether or not you want to like run a browser.
16:29 Mario Elysian: And get the get the latest information. So it's like at least gives you like a couple layers of information where The latency, I guess. Yeah, the reason I'm kind of working up the stack is that like this is probably like the lowest latency type of solution. It's like, Oh if we can provide an answer through the map, At least the map can be executed in like under a second and it can show you where what you need. Sometimes it has the answer almost all of the time it has at least the URL. So it's like Oh you know if you type in literally restaurants
17:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
17:03 Mario Elysian: it'll probably like list like Yeah. Oh list all the major restaurants like open table, whatever. But it'll also lists like a bunch of random restaurants. We've come across. And no rank it, and it'll do all those things. But then if you want like more complete information off of it, you've you do have to open up the browser to find it which is really no different than how Yeah, companies like like kind of what open AI does at the end of it. So it's
17:32 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
17:33 Mario Elysian: kind of recreating a lot, a lot of that. But, you know, I think, I think kind of the this kind of all loops up to maybe just to summarize. It's like we have like our own proprietary browser system so we can see things on like through browser. We have other layers of looking at Internet information, which can all be looped up through. A memory bank that can like target with like make a quick decision on like which system to go through based on what we've seen. Then on top of that we have like a little map that are a big map that's currently sitting around like four or five million websites that we've kind of labeled and put into our system.
18:18 Mario Elysian: From there though it's like kind of you know if you think about kind of that how that whole stack works it's like we have like a natural language input we have the ability to like decompose things and figure out what you want. We can fire off you know, a whole bunch of browsers in parallel to kind of investigate that information and we can squash it back down and like send it back to you. So,
18:40 Joshua Munsch: Mmm.
18:43 Mario Elysian: That's kind of like the basics of, you know, how like our our tech stack kind of works but maybe the question that that has been lingering on our mind and we've
18:48 Joshua Munsch: Got it.
18:53 Mario Elysian: actually had taken a couple tries at this which is like if you think about how that text that works and like you stand above it as a user and you like See all the you can like understand all these layers below. It's like kind of if you come in as like a first time, you know, if you think about from like a traditional, first time user experience things like How do you Teach that type of concept to somebody. How do you like? I mean most people either think about Google Chat GPT or Maybe the Openai browser type of paradigm and it's like, Okay well either I will
19:26 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
19:30 Mario Elysian: chat with it and the browser will do things. I will chat with it and it'll find search results and summarize them for me or I will, I will type it into a box and it will give me a bunch of links and it's like, Well, all three of those are really kind of variants of the original, which is the Google search box, which provides links. And it's like, well, Everything else? Is a variant.
19:54 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
19:57 Mario Elysian: but the thing that I, the tiny fish, we're trying to challenge is like, how do we Understand what the next? Realm of Internet, interactions are beyond like that searching and finding type of thing. And how do we go about? pitching that to people as something that's both unique and You know, one of those like Moments in technology. That's like, this is, this is fundamentally different and captures like the inspiration of people, you know, I would say like a starting with businesses, but then be like, you know, of course that, you know, Maybe developers in general and then see like the general public because it's like, you know, I guess. One thing that we think a lot about from branding is like How do we tell people that we're trying to operate the Internet. Like it's like it doesn't matter if it's an API, a browser, whatever systems we have, we just push all of that down. So that all you can, all you need to do is just say, like, I want something and right now, that's like, you know, most of it, even if you think about a Google search is read, only like It's like, I will locate you information and I will push it back and you will, you will do whatever you need to do. You click it, you'll book it, you'll do whatever. But if you think about
21:37 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
21:39 Mario Elysian: this next layer of the, you know, we can call it like the agentic stuff or even just kind of how You know, chat is what what Llms are capable of. It's like, Well, why does it stop there? If you give it a credit card, can it just buy things for you? Should it? How, how do you do that? How do you trust it? So I
21:57 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
22:01 Mario Elysian: think kind of when when I think about kind of this whole layer of like what onboarding sounds like, there's probably like a couple of approaches of like introducing How how you introduced the technology, what it's capable of and kind of what
22:16 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
22:18 Mario Elysian: roots? We we want to intro like like what what is like the pacing or like how we want to introduce? Or like, what does even like the high level like First principles concept that we want to bring, is it about just saying like, Hey, this looks like you're, you're normal chat search box or This is something much much more, you know, interesting. And honestly like the man called the mandate like the ask from like, you know, I think all the leadership is inspired to think about this and like In a much, much bigger way. But also communicate I guess you could say, like, You know that it just works. Like I'll put I'll put it that way. Like How does
23:10 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
23:11 Mario Elysian: it feel to the user? Like it just works. It doesn't like Ask you for all sorts of random permissions or whatever doesn't like you know. So so I think that there's like of course like the balance of you know mixing like what the technology is capable of with the inspiration but also thinking about like how do you build an interface around? Like it's not just a browser, it's not just these things. It's all of these things combined and what does that unlock. So you know I think that that's maybe
23:36 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
23:40 Mario Elysian: my my overall. Prompt for kind of what I'm what I think some of the challenges are right now and it's like I don't think there's any wrong answer as much as like, you know, making it like a Google search is like, one way of doing it. That's maybe not the realm that we want to play and actually we want to be more of like both, like I guess you could say like a thought leader, but also push The.
24:14 Mario Elysian: World on thinking a little differently about like how these things emerge and we want to play that role of like well if everything's settling on like, you know, a chat box and a scrolling thing of transcript.
24:24 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
24:31 Mario Elysian: Like, is there something better?
24:33 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
24:34 Mario Elysian: And what is that thing? So it's like that That answer may take many many, you know, iterations and thoughts to go after, but of course, I want to, you know, maybe open that up as something that like the design team will probably be focusing on very intently, over the next years even
24:55 Joshua Munsch: Well, it's quite a deep. It's quite a deep thought.
24:57 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
24:59 Joshua Munsch: I think.
24:59 Mario Elysian: But oh, yeah. And then I'll just summarize by saying like, you know, when I,
25:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, good.
25:03 Mario Elysian: when I interviewed a few months ago, like, my initial thought was like, tiny Fish is a company that builds railroads, To like places on the Internet. You like you, you may see like some random like high-speed rail line kind of like going through it, but it's like Oh we can build any railroad low speed subway high speed to any point that we want on the Internet.
25:29 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
25:30 Mario Elysian: And now that we built that that railroad, what do you do with it? Like, you can send cargo over, you can send passengers, you can, you know, turn into. Yeah, high speed one, you can turn it into a local railroad. You can, you know, have a Christmas show on it with the like, if you remember like the caltrain thing it's like the they do like a weird like Holiday Show, but it's like, you know, the what you do on it is the the thing that when railroads first came out, all these railroad owners, the people that own, the railroads started being able to charge for the usage of it. So I think if you start thinking about this like in a much much more longer term view.
26:14 Mario Elysian: The automation stack of everything that goes underneath. Just looks like a railroad and now
26:20 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
26:20 Mario Elysian: Are you are you booking every concert ticket via a tiny fish? Are you booking? Every restaurant are you You know Are these things? Scheduled automated Is it
26:25 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
26:31 Mario Elysian: listening to what you want to do Constantly? Is it built into Siri? Is it built into? Whatever you? Yeah, you can start thinking about like, Well if it can really truly execute like this, Why isn't it doing? You know, Why isn't it built into my homepod or, you know, exactly etc, etc. But I think getting to that step is is kind of the, maybe the challenge of the moment that I I want to
26:54 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
26:57 Mario Elysian: Yeah, we can we can talk a little bit more about
27:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
27:00 Mario Elysian: so I'll pause there, because I think that that is my Yeah, my overall.
27:09 Joshua Munsch: Over here now super helpful and super exciting. I think like it gives me.
27:10 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
27:14 Joshua Munsch: There's a lot going through my head in terms of just like what it could be in, work could go and I think before I get into, like drilling into like, you know, Users scenarios who we want to focus on etc. Like when you talk about this, like it just makes me think about like, Like what are the ways in which like Why do we go to the Internet, right? And there's like, numerous use cases for it. There's like you said to search for something like I go to Google or chat GPT because I'm looking for information whether that's to book a concert ticket or achieve some sort of outcome. I guess they're all often outcome based but then there's like
27:53 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
27:54 Joshua Munsch: There's entertain myself to. communicate like right now, like there's all of these different sort of Ways in which we use it. I think there's something interesting there around just like The intention also like this segment of my life for work. I'm using it in a
28:11 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
28:13 Joshua Munsch: certain way. For my personal life, I'm using it in a certain way and there's kind of overlap in certain cases, but like, I don't know, I think there's interesting areas to go in. Through that. And
28:24 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
28:26 Joshua Munsch: I guess to kind of like bring this back to maybe the the top right hand the task like In terms of what you're looking to explore here, is it? You know, more of this blue sky, like anyone. Anyone is a cut or anyone is a user of tiny fish? Or is it like the The Enterprise customer who has some workflow.
28:52 Mario Elysian: I mean, if I said something like, You know, I guess feel free challenge me on this. Like every enterprise customer is a person and people have inherent natural, like, you know, things that they want to see. They don't want to be like confused. They don't want to feel like this is You know, at least at this point in the world of technology it's like they don't want to open up another word. Doc, they don't want to open up another, you know, as much as they feel like they they think they may be trained to do that. It's like, they don't want to open up outlook, they don't want to open up Gmail. They don't want to, you know, have like the like all of these. These types of tools are ones that like I would say like Outlook or Gmail especially are like It's an inbox cue, you have to process it and then you your your outcome is like an inbox zero or something like that. So it's like fundamentally. It's like it
29:48 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
29:50 Mario Elysian: is like a processed cue that you're trying to do and you're the person that's automating it it's not something else. So it is kind of like you know, I think
29:55 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
29:59 Mario Elysian: that there's probably like one part of this which is like Yes. It's like the enterprise thing but it's also like The outcome is that somebody is able to do something better with their time. That is more meaningful to the work that they you know whatever industry they're
30:17 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
30:18 Mario Elysian: in. You know I'd say it's like the Photoshop Self-healing tool. I think we briefly might have mentioned that in the past but like, you know, like before
30:27 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
30:31 Mario Elysian: you had to like airbrush, a actual photo and, and a photo studio and like, you know, expose it and render and, you know, put it in the little bath and everything. And it's like, now you just go and it's gone and it's like, well photographer spent more time, focusing on other things, lighting and better, you know, composition and better. Just like you just put more of your energy to those things. So I think that yeah, what we want to think about how tiny fish works is like similar to that as well where it's like, How much of, you know, I guess knowing kind of, the realm of, like, Llms etc.
31:11 Mario Elysian: It's like how much of that can we can we understand and also find ways to improve their You know, their workflows, but maybe it's also a little bit of like an open-ended discovery of what they're working on and how we can fit into it.
31:27 Joshua Munsch: Interesting.
31:28 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
31:29 Joshua Munsch: Just based on what you've seen. Do you think there are like core workflows, that represent a solid kind of mapping of again if you think about it as like how people use the Internet or again just like tasks, we
31:46 Mario Elysian: Mmm.
31:47 Joshua Munsch: hire the your browser for like Are there any thoughts on like? Yeah? Like what are maybe like core ones that might be worth. Considering as a, in a first place, I'm happy to bring someone that as well, but just curious, if
32:00 Mario Elysian: Yeah, well maybe just for the sake of not leaving it. Open-ended, let me, let me show you another thing real quick. Which is something we worked on. This was actually even before the the demo that you probably saw in the video, this is a site. We have of we just made like within like a few hours we just five coated a very very basic site that renders all the API information that we have going through the just the browser layer. This isn't like the layers above it yet.
32:35 Joshua Munsch: I'm
32:36 Mario Elysian: So we have these like ideas of like I guess what, you'll call like a project and I mean like you know, wait there's there's no judgment. You can judge however you want. It's like you have to fill out all these fields in order to like create a new project but once you create a project you have you can like maybe let me just pick one from From further back with Oh man. This is just like our internal company one. If I search for like say like class pass, I think. Yeah, you know, class pass is one of our customers and we have these jobs that they run. This is just one use case, just to show you like how Classpass uses it. It is a they send to the tiny fish system there. Basically, once he every few weeks, they want to know what the latest prices are on approximately 30,000, fitness studios and you know, hair salons, whatever the inventory that they uses. And it's that's kind of how when you go in class passing, you're trying book something. It actually comes from them pulling the information off of the local.
34:04 Mario Elysian: Website, and then updating their own data table. So, previously they were either doing this through a mix of various methods, including having a small team and another country
34:17 Joshua Munsch: I just
34:17 Mario Elysian: Literally going to the website and plugging it into a Google sheet and it would just update it. So and this was as recent is just a few months ago and now on
34:25 Joshua Munsch: Crazy.
34:29 Mario Elysian: top of that like they also offer like these kind of bundles where like oh if you want to like order a smoothie after your like your your workout session or something like that, they partner with other restaurants to like do that. And then it turns out what that system was was literally somebody like saying like I want to smoothie and then it was a email that was sent to
34:56 Joshua Munsch: Why?
34:57 Mario Elysian: Center in another country and somebody just opened up the inbox and placed an order on doordash. So it's literally just like pure manual, like mechanical Turk type of, like, level of automation, that was going on as recent as earlier this
35:12 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
35:13 Mario Elysian: year when we started talking to them. So, one of the things that we we just wanted to like find solutions for them that was even just like at a very, very base layer. Like, for example, this one Which is just a cue that they can basically load up the hopper with as many URLs as they want. And you can see that it's just like, you know, they they just continue to add them from time to time. They don't have to wait for like running a whole batch job. They can just add it and within a couple minutes, those answers will come back. If they want to refresh it, they can just hit like a run all jobs or or reset the logic Reparse here. There's a lot of like, you know, this is probably like layer deeper than we even need to talk about but just to kind of show you like how the how the actual system works. It's like some some
36:03 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
36:06 Mario Elysian: sites are just invalid but class pass works, you know all around the world. So like for example like this is one in Germany and you can kind of hit the run that has a little browser here that will you know, it's connecting to our data center and it's loading it up and You can see on the right side it has just kind of a stream of all the things that it's doing. It'll have some sometimes it goes out to our LMS to think. But
36:35 Joshua Munsch: Like schedule visible or anything.
36:42 Mario Elysian: most of the time it's actually doing things within its own proprietary system of trying to figure out what the logic is of the page. It's scrolling through the page to understand what's going on. So, it's reading it, it's trying to find the right thing and, you know, this This is in the the goal input is in English but we're actually like you know, if
37:03 Mario Elysian: it is another language Oh this is actually a live browser too so again we can click on things while we're doing this. But yeah you can see it's like trying to understand what's going on and it's like I don't know where it went here. Fitness now, and it's like checking every page right now because this doesn't have the Um, yeah, so it's looking for the schedule. It's looking for how the prices work and things like that. How did end up on class pass? Well, maybe it's
37:40 Joshua Munsch: And what does that? What does it look like? As a result currently. So like If I'm class pass maybe like, Yeah, what's the is
37:46 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
37:49 Joshua Munsch: it just kind of like Just dump your URLs here and then we send you reports or
37:53 Mario Elysian: So it is an API. So it's like, all of this is really just exposing what the APIs doing, so you can just send it like a CSV, or just like a JSON of URLs and it will return a JSON of or yeah. Things like what you see here, which is basically the final result. So, it's like,
38:12 Joshua Munsch: Got it.
38:14 Mario Elysian: It's you know, set up. to show like the, you know, these are the like the values that class pass uses if it exists where it's like, like if if there are like Things on those websites that are already like prepackaged with like some discount, they'll load it. Otherwise, they'll calculate those values off of, like, kind of the price per Per month. So yeah, so it's like, you know, this gives them everything that they they're they're looking for including the currency and then they will load this into their database and update all the prices on on those things on Classpass. So it is kind of at least one step in like a completely automated flow for them.
39:00 Joshua Munsch: Interest.
39:06 Mario Elysian: And, you know, as I, as I mentioned, like, especially for a flow like this, the
39:07 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
39:13 Mario Elysian: API as we start adding in like this memory bank thing or the and a web thing, it's like basically it will start optimizing. This this goal thing here and not
39:27 Mario Elysian: sure if we have any projects that are like testing that yet. Maybe. See here, seeing some of our, our friends in here that are working on projects with other companies. I don't know, maybe this one was. This one have? Yeah, this is a little bit more of an optimized one. Where you can see like we we kind of ran it through the secondary like memory bank and now it returns like something even more like these are the URLs but it's like Like, I think very specifically, it's like go to this exact page because Somebody asked for something and it's like, Oh it figured out how to like set the the, you know, the URL to like the right page. So it doesn't have to go to the top layer website, for example. So this is like an example of an
40:27 Joshua Munsch: You yeah.
40:30 Mario Elysian: optimization that happens. And now it returns like the list of products much, much faster than having to go all the way to like the athleta gap. Calm. And then like search for the Bottoms category, page, and etc. Etc. It's like, well I
40:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
40:47 Mario Elysian: I've seen we've seen it before. So we're just going to feed you like the exact link. You have to go to. And now all you have to do is like visit that page that's you know, 50, 75, 90% less page loads versus the one we just saw. Previously that doesn't do. It's like in literally like you know and some like if it doesn't have an answer it's going to brute force its way through and as fast as it can to understand. And you know that's just kind of like you can imagine it's like the first time it runs it takes a little bit longer but every time it gets quicker and quicker and quicker. Yeah. Yeah.
41:18 Joshua Munsch: If so it's self updates and understands like, Okay, now I just need to hit this link directly instead of having to click around in search or something, that's very cool.
41:28 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah. And one thing that I'm starting to work on is like, a way to
41:28 Joshua Munsch: Not it.
41:35 Mario Elysian: abstract that out to like understanding like categories of websites. Like, for example, like every shopify website, if it's run through to shopify platform actually, has like a common CMS. So they all have common, like things like
41:49 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
41:52 Mario Elysian: common header type, and a common footer, and common like category names and common search box title, things like that and that is also like information. Like if you think about it and like the way that You know, you and I as designers think about, it's like, Yeah, I kind of starts reducing it down to like those common common elements which even speeds things up, even more, which is just like, you know, it's called, you know, search underscore box and just go by just go look for that. Just search for that
42:18 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
42:20 Mario Elysian: element rather than, like, trying to hunt around for what you're looking for.
42:21 Joshua Munsch: Interesting.
42:25 Mario Elysian: So, you know, we can we can make the instructions, very, very specific. So, When you're executing it like like an API. Like, I mean, the return of like, the initial time is, you know, two minutes sometimes for complex queries. And then for optimized ones, we can get it under 40 seconds for a complex query where it's like, you know, the site will literally only appear for like half a second, just as long as we can. We can read it, and then it's like, Oh, click on that, and then click on that, click on that clear on that. So, you know, there are
42:55 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
42:57 Mario Elysian: things like that where it's like, even for an insurance company that we're working with it. It processes things, and under like, it can actually get an insurance quote, from a competitor's website, 50, something steps, and under two
43:14 Mario Elysian: minutes. So it's like very it. Can once you start like, knowing what to do on the page, you can start working very, very rapidly through it. And, you know, we're not necessarily in the business of trying to API everything. It's more about like you know, the end the world and the Will grow and mutate as it does. And we want to be adaptive to handling that.
43:35 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
43:37 Mario Elysian: And just like, you know, if you think about, if I'm more generic solutions like, well, we can't just like Yeah, it can't just be like one or other type of solution one. Type of way of thinking about it it's more of like generally it's like we you want the outcome and then all of these little browsers maybe just to finish. My my thought Here it's like you know we talked about the railroad. This is this is the seeing like the railroad being like layout.
44:02 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
44:03 Mario Elysian: and then now that path exists like you know like for many of our companies end up and the e-commerce space They're actually looking at other companies websites for, like, understanding the coupons and the competitive pricing, so they're like, Oh you know, let's go see what the price is on Amazon and will lower or adjust our price accordingly and You know all those things are like, you know, they're they're pinging it like 10 15 times a day.
44:38 Mario Elysian: but for like an everyday user though, it's like oh if you get to that page like We get the like the price all the way like the checkout. So it's like we do it localized like zip codes and coupons involved, and things like that. So it's
44:55 Joshua Munsch: Mm-hmm.
44:56 Mario Elysian: like, now you're at the green button that says, like order and for, you know, somebody that wants to buy that thing. Can we just hit the button? So there's
45:05 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
45:06 Mario Elysian: kind of like that, two-parter, which I think it's like, you know, we can either included or excluded as part of King, But I think there is like this. Interesting aspect of like the way this this thing works is like, you can tell it to go. All the way to the. Checkout page and I mean, if you want to type in your credit card, credentials into that, that little field it will just type it in.
45:31 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
45:33 Mario Elysian: And do it, but it's like we kind of stop there. Because, of course, we just don't want to do this, like, security implications about for all sorts of things. But it's like it's also not Like if somebody demands it out of the system, it will currently do it.
45:51 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
45:51 Mario Elysian: So like yeah anyway so yeah that is kind of how the the browser system works and
45:52 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
45:59 Mario Elysian: I'll show you one more thing which I'll also send you after as well. Which maybe we can even use as a starting point. Where is my I got so many windows open. So the system that at least, maybe I'll show you kind of more of what the current state is that we have in our, our internal system. Which is what I've been working on which looks more like this. So what you saw earlier was something, we had like, maybe two months ago that we just like built up just to even show people like what the API looks like that we had created and now we're working on. Yeah, actually putting that out into like something. It's a little bit more self-service. So this is, this is my version.
46:47 Joshua Munsch: so, this is that Or is this test run?
46:49 Mario Elysian: I'm sorry. This is, this is the layer up and we call Minnow, like the little
46:54 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
46:55 Mario Elysian: little fish, but it is part of what the demo you saw in the videos, but this is the onboarding screen I guess that we have right now for that, that system where it's like, Okay, let's introduce you to how the browser works at this point. Because it's like, this can be like, even one query can be turned into an API, you can change them together. You can add as many URLs as you want into a project like you saw, but even just for like, creating like a little playground for people to test out like how just understanding how to browser works.
47:31 Joshua Munsch: You yeah.
47:32 Mario Elysian: We wanted to create at least kind of one way for you know if we have like you know people that are visiting the site and just you know you've probably seen this with like other things like 11 labs or you know, other other types of
47:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
47:48 Mario Elysian: technologies like it's very similar to that. It's like figure out how the API works. Like you can see all sorts of things. So you know it right now, I called it, try a search but it's like, you know, you can, you know, we have our USPS thing. And yeah, I mean you can actually see some of the some of the elements that I brought in and it's like Oh this is just hard coded right now that I have a little pop-up that's like a feedback indicator of like here's how it will.
48:18 Mario Elysian: Here's how long it'll take and how it will work. We have little little, you
48:21 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
48:23 Mario Elysian: know, you can check like the different types of browsers that you can, you know, use because this is just more of an experiment, you know. Also it'll auto select it and in the paid version that you can do like one with the antibot detection or one that specifically in the US or when it's specifically in the EU you can. Yeah. Kind of you know, figure out, you know basic queries or you can like type in your own. Like you know, what are the hours of? I don't know. In and out and Mountain View or something like that.
49:07 Joshua Munsch: Is it important questions?
49:09 Mario Elysian: Yeah. but you can you can type in queries as like Vegas this or as complex as like I don't know. Let me see if I can find one real quick just to show you like the range of of things. But I guess you know, one thing to also think about here is Like yeah, like how, how do people understand what they can do with this? Because I guess maybe to answer my own question. The first thing I wanted to start off with this, like the Maybe it looks like a search box. And like, what does that mean?
49:43 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
49:46 Mario Elysian: you know, like like for example, like one that we actually know is a case that people Really want is something as complex as actually. This one, you can't see. I need to figure out how to do the multiline but it's like find a cheapest used Honda Civic that needs all the following criteria under 25,000 fewer than 30,000 miles includes apple. Carplay adaptive cruise control and blind spot centers on
50:10 Joshua Munsch: Oh my God.
50:10 Mario Elysian: carvana. I mean,
50:13 Joshua Munsch: That's yeah.
50:14 Mario Elysian: We can try this one. I don't know how it's actually going to work. But yeah, you can hit run and it'll open up a single instance, of the browser should be going to carvana, and it's going to probably get through this cloud favorite thing, but maybe not. Yeah. Okay so it's like can't visit. Because it had the thing. So maybe we can try one of the other ones here may or may not work cloud. There's pretty aggressive with Maybe it did. Maybe it didn't. Yeah.
50:52 Mario Elysian: If we can get through the yeah, it's not going to well yeah, so I mean maybe this is also kind of like another, you know, thing to think about when it's like the browser it's like, you know, there is a whole
51:04 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
51:05 Mario Elysian: world of companies are actually trying to, you know, Limit. Yeah, so yeah, I mean this is kind of another another thing to, you know,
51:09 Joshua Munsch: Stop it.
51:18 Mario Elysian: also think about of like, Yeah, we we can have our, we can have our own own roots to to, you know, trying to solve this as much as we can. But it is a bit of a, you know, cat and mouse.
51:30 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
51:31 Mario Elysian: Of chase that's going on and it's just going to continue to happen on the Internet. Like you know like for example like you know Twitter did this very long time ago as well they like blocked all sorts of people from accessing it so but yeah this is actually just like I I just extracted this page from the um, Let me just stop sharing. I just extracted this page out of our, our sandbox. And I actually put in a github repo for you to
52:09 Joshua Munsch: oh,
52:10 Mario Elysian: Take a look at. Let me just give you the link once I find it. Yeah, I mean you're you're welcome to use this as like a starting point or a non-starting point.
52:29 Mario Elysian: https://github.com/mariodelgado/singleurl
52:31 Mario Elysian: And it is a everything in there, should be hard coded and it's only valid for 24 hours or something like that. So, if you need to renew it I can I can renew things. But yeah, you can take a look at that project. It's just kind of like a self-contained. I think that's everything and it should just be I asked Claude to make it a self-contained HTML file. So you can kind of expand on it. However, you want.
52:58 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
53:00 Mario Elysian: At least just give you like a simple starting point, but
53:04 Joshua Munsch: This is awesome. It's exciting to, at least, like visually see something because
53:08 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
53:10 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, not that we've been talking to abstract but just to kind of at least see a single manifestation of it. Like in the visual form is is very exciting. I think it's super cool like
53:20 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
53:22 Joshua Munsch: this is,
53:23 Mario Elysian: So I I know I've been talking a lot and I'll stop here because I'll say like this is just one example, and I'm actually curious like, of all the things we've talked about like maybe is this the right type of approach? And then also, there's kind of like the question of like, Yeah, this is kind of a snapshot of like, well there's probably a home page before and a sign up link after like is with, if this is a moment between the two of those like
53:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
53:50 Mario Elysian: What else or how creatively could we get to? Like helping? Somebody understand how this the system works and get them super excited about the Potential of it as well.
54:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
54:01 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
54:02 Joshua Munsch: even just like, looking at what you've put together, a couple things come to mind, I'm kind of maybe pre ideating, and then we can maybe bring back down like
54:12 Mario Elysian: Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
54:15 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, there's that first landing moment that you like obviously a lot of people are doing it even with the search box today. Like it's basically, you know, trying to get someone to like engage right away and I think they're
54:25 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
54:26 Joshua Munsch: Essentially interesting things you could do from again, like completely logged out, we don't know a ton about the person but like what signals can we pull? Whether it is like their location or
54:38 Mario Elysian: You know.
54:39 Joshua Munsch: if there's I don't know if there's any other signals we can sort of like grab into that like okay, this person's a male, he lives in Dallas like we could recommend, you know, Concerts happening in Dallas or I don't know, just like different like paths for that. and then there's kind of that like next step of like okay, this gets really powerful when we know, just like a little bit more about you and being able to like Effort. Not absolutely. But you know, in a friction as friction free possible way captured a little bit of information. So that like that landing view becomes like just like 10 times more valuable, you know.
55:18 Mario Elysian: He?
55:19 Joshua Munsch: and so anyways, that's where my head went when you're showing me that and so maybe to like Bring it back like for the project, is it? Like is this where we should focus? Then is this kind of like first moment with Minnow is that like what you're thinking is what I'm
55:36 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah, I think knowing kind of, at least hearing my hearing me out on, like, kind of how the technology works is. Like, That's like, you know, not something. I, I think anybody should expect these or understands, like, on day one, but they should understand that. Like, it works. So maybe like, within that
55:52 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
55:57 Mario Elysian: The case that I just showed. Actually doesn't work. And how do we handle something like that? I guess it's kind of one, one type of thing, but I would also say, like, you know, if the outcome is to get somebody to sign up for this and start using it like Oh, these are just kind of like vague questions. Is there a way that we can either guide them into the potential of what we can do? Or Find a like, is it about finding concert tickets? Because we can do that on Google too. I think, you know, and it may be quicker, but it's more about like the yeah. How do we kind of enlighten them to like, what they Could do. And I think that from, from there, I think it's like, how to explain this like How do you you know, maybe now that you're seeing this for the first time, Like maybe what were the principles that you were thinking about that led to you saying, like how do you make this more personal? I'm curious maybe we can kind of start with that of like what why was that your first Impression.
57:17 Joshua Munsch: because I think, like, yeah, when you hit these views again, I think we're used to seeing these kind of like templated starting places that maybe aren't super relevant but if there's like Like the car the carbon example kind of hit because I'm currently we just had another kid and I'm like looking for another car. It's like seeing that was
57:38 Mario Elysian: Oh yeah.
57:40 Joshua Munsch: relevant right? I think.
57:42 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Okay.
57:43 Joshua Munsch: And and might you show like that meant something to me because I'm like, God, I'm like spending my evenings right now.
57:49 Mario Elysian: Mmm.
57:50 Joshua Munsch: Going to all of these, like they're clicking different links, like filling out my information. Now, I've got like a million dealerships calling me, you know, like there's just like this pain that I felt that like that one hit home. And so it's like How can you quickly connect with that person in some way to like say like, Hey we understand you and we can go do this work for you. I think another level that could be interesting and this is like Maybe a little bit in the positioning as well. Like, you know, you enter the your or you into the query, we're showing you the browser.
58:18 Mario Elysian: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
58:22 Joshua Munsch: it's almost like, I don't even want to. I don't even know if I want to watch the browser. Like I want to enter my query and like piece like go handle it and then let me know when you're ready for like These things out. And so I think there's like another aspect of just like you know, instead of you know, If people connected not that we're saying it's browser automation or anything, but it's more like, you know, we're gonna go like do this for you. Come back to you with like some some real information and like whether it's like next, steps decisions. Like I don't know, just some action versus like, just a bunch of research, if that makes sense. And so that's kind of like, where my where my head went. But I think it is about like, How can we connect to whether it's pain or like a goal that a person has as quickly as possible. So that
59:10 Mario Elysian: but,
59:11 Joshua Munsch: They can quickly grasp the, like value of like, what's happening under the hood and what's like, being done for them, if that makes sense.
59:20 Mario Elysian: Yeah. I mean, your case is actually very Interesting. Because it's like it's actually very similar to like one. Like I can't tell you to hold back story around how that carbon a thing popped up but you know the the case that you're actually talking about is actually very, very Interesting. Because it's like you you actually want To hear back from the dealer. Not just carvana it's like, Oh like assume we find it then of course, there's
59:54 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
59:54 Mario Elysian: always like a button. And now, the dealer's just constantly calling you because
59:58 Joshua Munsch: Yes.
59:59 Mario Elysian: they, you know, you enter their sales system and then all of a sudden they're just like you know, they know you're alive person.
01:00:06 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:00:07 Mario Elysian: But it's almost like, can you just Get me a time to go see it. For example, why not? And yeah, I mean I'm kind of curious. Like, if you were to like Yeah. I mean if we were just to like step through like how you would try and compose a system like that. To try and, you know, get the outcome you're looking for. What type of? Like, maybe just like on.
01:00:41 Mario Elysian: You know, outside of what you just saw with the, the input in the browser, things like, What type of thing would you want to see? Or you think should be
01:00:48 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
01:00:49 Mario Elysian: seen to nor in order to like achieve those types of things because it's like a like a workflow that doesn't have to look like a workflow I guess it's like you don't think about it as like You just think about the outcome. You know.
01:01:02 Joshua Munsch: No, it's There. this man, I'm gonna do one more riff and then, This like makes me think of another example, I guess use. And again, I feel like
01:01:14 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah.
01:01:14 Joshua Munsch: it's helpful for me to visualize when I put it into actual, like, use cases is like We just had like our age for like courtyard in our house redone. In that process of like contacting contractors. Having them come over to my house to schedule a time to then like find making a decision. And so I think there's like again there's a lot of these just like High value like back in things that could happen without me being involved. And I just basically show up and so I definitely think There's something interesting here, I'm curious like just based on what you're saying. Are you thinking potentially scope scope some of this to that like as a sort of like guiding thread or
01:01:59 Mario Elysian: Yeah, yeah. I mean, why not I think that you know, I think your your use case is actually quite compelling, because it is a It's actually not too different from the more complex cases, that that we currently work on. And
01:02:17 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:02:19 Mario Elysian: I mean like assumed that like it can be possible. How would you, you know, reorient this to serve that goal? I think it's kind of
01:02:33 Mario Elysian: the questions. Like, This is just kind of like, you know, a base interaction. It's like now what what sort of thing. could we build on top of it to like,
01:02:42 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:02:43 Mario Elysian: Make that happen. Yeah.
01:02:45 Joshua Munsch: Okay. Yeah, let me start.
01:02:46 Mario Elysian: I think all things I would say like almost all things are possible including like Yeah committing the action. Let's assume that because it's yeah.
01:02:53 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Let me take some natural like,
01:02:58 Mario Elysian: Yeah, please.
01:03:03 Joshua Munsch: so, Because I guess I kind of want to just make sure I understand the task at hand. So, with this, like what we're talking about is, Someone anyone really coming to. The men of sight or tiny fish. Um, how would you like to refer to it? So I get
01:03:24 Mario Elysian: Um either one really I mean minnow is the actual product so we can say it's
01:03:25 Joshua Munsch: that right.
01:03:30 Mario Elysian: minnow. Yeah.
01:03:31 Joshua Munsch: Comes to Minnow.
01:03:33 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:03:36 Joshua Munsch: And like, do we want it just to understand? Do we want to anchor into that? Sort of like, I looking for a car or that kind of, I guess, use case, where there's a process involved of Getting to an actual. Whether it's like booked appointment or like
01:03:54 Mario Elysian: I mean, you could say it's like like it's a abstract, you know, outcome that you're looking for. Like, it doesn't have to be like a specific outcome I guess. It's like I want to buy a car that You know, fits my needs. Something like that. I mean, you can, you can be more specific but also like, Well, I don't want to say too much, but you can you can think about like you
01:04:21 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:04:23 Mario Elysian: know how somebody would step through that to even like input the right thing.
01:04:28 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Because even like the two example, the car example. And then like finding the The contractor. The question there would be like, finding a
01:04:36 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:04:40 Joshua Munsch: a landscape artist that like, matches my like, Aesthetic and price point, right? Like there's
01:04:46 Mario Elysian: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So it's like, you're, you're not going to say that maybe up front?
01:04:52 Joshua Munsch: Right. But those are the kind of the To the underlying psychology that is like helping or leading my like decision. And so, alright, kind of like the goal that I that I have in mind, okay?
01:05:00 Mario Elysian: Right. Right.
01:05:10 Joshua Munsch: So it's like, actually outcome. These task, those are a few examples. I've written down. and then, in terms of just like, I think the main thing we want to highlight is just like how you facilitate I guess achieving that goal.
01:05:32 Joshua Munsch: Is that correct? Like come to the site? How to take them through, getting them
01:05:34 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:05:38 Joshua Munsch: to that end result of again, whether it's like, Scheduling detector like getting to scheduling a test drive or again, finding that right? First cetera depending on like the
01:05:49 Mario Elysian: Yeah. All right, right. Yeah, I think you're the this is actually quite interesting because it's like, well at certain stages we either. May need to. Ask your refining question or we can? Ask it up front, like, if you think about like how the deep research thing works like they ask you a few things up from before they run it. But Like, is there a way? We can reduce that to as, as little Refining Questions as possible. Maybe to your point of like, you know, can we get their location? Can we like Figure anything else out about them. To help.
01:06:38 Mario Elysian: At least kind of read their mind a little bit better about what they think they want.
01:06:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:06:47 Mario Elysian: Or is it something like providing a spectrum of options? I don't know, I mean maybe there's a couple different ways to to kind of approach. I mean, there's definitely like many ways to approach this but yeah, it could be like a like I I don't know what you're looking for but you probably don't want a Like I mean there's probably like some like logical things. Like You don't want somebody with bad ratings, you don't want somebody that's far away. You don't want blah blah and it's like you probably want somebody with, you know, good reviews and testimonials on their site and you know, like but I think some of these things like Maybe if you think about it, it's like How would you do that yourself as well? Like, you would probably start browsing around and like trying to like, abstractly, you're just trying to get a sense of like what's possible before you like, you know, dive in deep. And it's like you
01:07:40 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:07:41 Mario Elysian: want to know like, Okay, how much this is gonna cost me, you know, What types of things are even possible. Do some things require like deep
01:07:49 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:07:52 Mario Elysian: permitting and like so you kind of want to be able to like abstractly like you know, not get too deep because you don't want to start spending too much, you know, server time on like doing some things but it's like you also want to like show that you're grocking your, your The person's request, right? Yeah.
01:08:13 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. It's interesting because you're kind of at different states, I guess, right. Depending on. Yeah, where you're at in these whether it's like again for the car prices are easy to find so that's like clear, but like redoing your yard for example is I have no idea how much this is gonna even like cost. And so there are these different just sort of layers that you kind of have to like peel back in order to get to That outcome.
01:08:42 Mario Elysian: Right.
01:08:51 Joshua Munsch: Okay. Nothing else. I might want to ask you. See. so okay, maybe the way I'm thinking about it and would love to get your feedback is a just in terms of like Essentially a deliverable of sorts or at least like what's gonna be included. And so I think I still need to kind of process through like what those like steps might be, but I think there's like, you know, the first meeting of men now The sort of next step of and I'll call it like, Setting a goal with minnow or an objective.
01:09:44 Joshua Munsch: Minnow. In some form doing it's magic and that will manifest in a number of ways. Once I get kind of really thinking about it and then kind of through that like, final step of Again, what Minnow has brought back to you and That's kind of like where my head is at in terms of like the overall experience at a high level, like Does that sound? It's you think that sounds.
01:10:08 Mario Elysian: Yeah, that's not. Yeah, yeah. I mean I think it's like, you know, the outcome of this could be like I guess. Well, maybe there's kind of like the question of like, you know, this is still a small product, they can do quite a lot. How do you separate what? You can do versus what you can't do, and set the user up for the right expectations. because like, I think this type of flow is possible but like, say I don't know, I want to import a car from Japan. That might not be possible, but
01:10:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:10:47 Mario Elysian: it's like, you know, I think it's like almost like Yeah. How do you understand? Like, you know, it's not going to be like chat, gbt where it's going to like attempt to do something and say, Sorry, I can't do this, and we're not gonna like, waste somebody's like Ideally, we don't want to waste anybody's time, and we also want to be able to say like, Yeah, we do.
01:11:10 Mario Elysian: complex, workflows where we can do some things, but it's also like a question of, like, if we come across that carvana one that I just showed you, like, We're kind of at a dead end. So what? Should we do there, if that happens.
01:11:26 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:11:28 Mario Elysian: and that's maybe, like, I don't really have a strong man as much as like, Yeah, what could we do? because I think until maybe we get to like another Layer of our technology. We may come up with some dead ends and that's okay.
01:11:47 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:11:48 Mario Elysian: It's plenty useful for the scope of like, you know, the websites that really, really work. And that's, that's fine. I think, right now, it's like, just more of, like, kind of like, it's okay to have a product that also, you know, Says that. I'm not quite there yet, but I. Yeah. And it's like, How do how do
01:12:09 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:12:11 Mario Elysian: you take that dead end and not turn away? Somebody, I guess is, maybe, maybe something to think about there.
01:12:17 Joshua Munsch: Interesting. Because, I mean, the Yeah. Okay. I feel like I have some ideas but I'll I'll leave them in there. I think the maybe I think about is just like, okay, well then what's like, the the baseline currently which is like probably what I can dia or
01:12:40 Mario Elysian: Hmm.
01:12:40 Joshua Munsch: Atlas does where it's like kind of just returned some information. On the flip side. It's like, you know, minnow actually going and really like going deep on these sites and getting the information and giving you like your next steps or I can even take in the next level further. I've actually taking action for you depending on like, how big that Decision is so.
01:13:02 Mario Elysian: Yeah, yeah. I mean
01:13:03 Joshua Munsch: But yeah.
01:13:06 Mario Elysian: yeah, maybe it's to think about like, maybe one other thing, you can kind of think about is like Is this actually all done in like kind of a one session type of thing? I mean some some things can be done like you could probably get to like a list of the contractors that you want to reach out to in like a table and like You know, their ratings and some feedback or something like that.
01:13:37 Mario Elysian: you know, some of the actions may be a little time delayed like, like booking a restaurant, like Pretty Instant, but like getting a quote from a contractor is
01:13:45 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:13:49 Mario Elysian: You know, may not get it until the next morning or something like that, so, maybe there's like kind of that. How do you handle Mile blatant C. Or How do you want to handle it or do you want to handle it a different way? Yeah.
01:14:06 Joshua Munsch: yeah, I thought about that after seeing the like the demo of Minnow and just like with you know, using cloud code for example, like there is There is downtime. And it's like, How do you make the most of that downtime in terms of either? Like the person that's sitting there waiting or It's like, we'll come back when we're ready? And so,
01:14:26 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think that that's also like there's there's of course always like an extreme risk of drop-off when it comes to those types of things.
01:14:36 Mario Elysian: So it's like How do you
01:14:37 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:14:38 Mario Elysian: Keep somebody. And I would say like, you know, like, Assume you also have like all tools that you're at your, you know. That can be utilized like. I mean like, you know, we can use text message, we can use Phone calls we can like, assume all those things can vaguely happen. I mean, like,
01:15:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Okay.
01:15:01 Mario Elysian: I think, I think actually like the Types of conversations that, you know, I think, We? Are slow Slowly starting to have Now that we've established the base technology. It's really like, How do we get this at into? Like the forefronts of other technologies as leverage for them to to really do their best jobs as well. Because sometimes it's like, you know be maybe a hidden layer and another company's technology but other times, it may be exposed as the primary thing for a user.
01:15:36 Joshua Munsch: Yep. Okay.
01:15:37 Mario Elysian: so, a little bit of this is kind of like you know, like, I don't know, it's kind of like Siri, I guess it's like, you know, Siri, technically, you can activate it and talk to it. But it also in the background makes, you know, calendar invites out of your emails, both the same system. One of them is just so, but I think it's like, in a similar way. It's like, Yeah, it's like a very powerful technology and I think that, you know, I'll keep throwing these things out because it's just like, I think some of this is maybe also like a, it's like a design slash product.
01:16:17 Mario Elysian: Question of, like, What does this thing do like? How do you understand what it is in the realm of all the things that people understand? But also like Yeah, what this is.
01:16:28 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:16:29 Mario Elysian: I think like there's no wrong answer to that either, so it's like, I'm actually curious, like you can think about that a little bit and Curious, like what? You're Opinion would be on like what that? That could be.
01:16:41 Joshua Munsch: yeah, I mean I'll definitely formulate more thoughts. It's yeah, I think there's this like position as a browser which I think means one thing I think the other thing is like, Another metaphor is like again, and then an assistant agent, obviously a bit.
01:16:58 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:16:58 Joshua Munsch: overdone right now but it is like something going out into the the world of the Internet and Doing things on your behalf and coming back to you. And so
01:17:10 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:17:11 Joshua Munsch: again sometimes that connects more to like again how I'm currently thinking about using it but yeah, we'll definitely Well, more on that. So Okay, cool. I feel like we're getting somewhere. I think one of the questions I have is just like in terms of of risk. it's based on what we've discussed, like, and just this project in the overall success of it, like any any risk you see right now with like It is a bit broad right now and I'm like there's benefit to that which I'm
01:17:47 Mario Elysian: Know.
01:17:47 Joshua Munsch: excited about, but I also want to make sure that I'm You know using the time effectively and so at least from your perspective, anything you want to call out and then I guess I can maybe share. Maybe.
01:18:01 Mario Elysian: I mean, I think kind of the Like I'm intentionally leaving it broad because I but I also don't have a like, Like how? Broad or refined you want to make the solution, I'll just leave that up to you, like, you can either choose to address it from or, or both or all the above. I mean, you can kind of Choose the one that you want to focus on there. I like there is no like waiting on like Oh this like, you know, trying to refine like one of the smaller interactions.
01:18:41 Mario Elysian: Yeah, I'm curious to hear just as much as like, you know, kind of what your thoughts are on the high level, because they think, you know, maybe to, you
01:18:47 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:18:50 Mario Elysian: know, because I think this is, like, a different style of discussion of the interview. It's also like, well, Part of this, This role also had basically has like both types of of approaches Throughout the week. Basically, like there are many. Amazing companies that we're starting to get in touch with and sometimes it is. A to be frank a little bit about kind of illuminating them to like what their own technologies are capable of.
01:19:21 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:19:22 Mario Elysian: with tiny fish, and it's a little bit of like, I don't know which we want to call it like our our CEO just really likes to Like he doesn't like to lose, I guess it's like a very much like I I We want to show up to every meeting like putting our best foot forward on like understanding them being able to explain the types of partnerships that we can do. But also like helping enlightened like what the potential of these things are and those things are I guess you could say at least in the startup realm it's like very rapid iterations on like using that time and that external feedback as almost like project. Conceptualizations like Oh what if we took the product like this way and we'll go pitch it to, you know, a company of like the needs to integrate it into like some major part of their Their product or, you know, there are companies that we are talking to the also have like user oriented uses of tiny fish that they'll put it as I guess you say like more of a distribution things. So it's like you know like that that core technology is now actually being flex across like a very large spectrum.
01:20:35 Mario Elysian: so, You know, I think that, of course, being a startup, we can't do everything. So it's also like, kind of a question of, like, it's also okay, to, like, draw a line and be very, very clear about like what it cannot do as well. So, you know, I think that there's like an interesting problem in that. But then within each of these things, of course, there's like really amazing.
01:20:58 Mario Elysian: Yeah, surface area as well to think about. So you know I'm not going to pressure
01:21:01 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:21:02 Mario Elysian: you to pick a pick one or the other. I don't I think either is actually quite Yeah. Interesting to think about and like I yeah, I won't, I won't guide you
01:21:10 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:21:13 Mario Elysian: towards anyone solution.
01:21:17 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:21:17 Mario Elysian: As much as like. Yeah. What do you think is like the best way to Show a little bit of like, your your How you want to? You know. I guess there's really only like Three other people that you'll probably be working with, like myself or Shoe. How who you? Talk to and Sideshar CEO. Most of the time and it's like, you know, between the
01:21:42 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:21:45 Mario Elysian: four of us, it's like well. you know, we can talk about it but it's also like Like, you know, you'll be empowered to kind of like, say like, Okay well we've got, you know, this meeting coming up with XY Company or we want to push out this ex-wife feature for our platform.
01:22:05 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:22:05 Mario Elysian: like, What's your supporting like reason that that's a good experience?
01:22:11 Joshua Munsch: Mmm. Okay.
01:22:12 Mario Elysian: If that makes sense. Yeah.
01:22:13 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Okay.
01:22:15 Mario Elysian: And it's like, we'd rather like Have you be able to own the principles and the like the reasons why, as well as the, you know, everything from there on on the product design too.
01:22:28 Joshua Munsch: Yep. Yep. Okay. I mean. I'm very excited to dig into this.
01:22:36 Mario Elysian: yeah, I'm intensely loading, you up with a few things here, just to see, like, you know, feel free to just like, you know, slash burn, cut through things, say, No, like there's really no like like, you can, you can also say, like I, I read through tiny fish and I think like, You have a giant like gaping hole in your product that you're not addressing, and it's bad. And like it's gonna crash and burn if you don't do this or you know, feel free to be critical. I think that that's just like yeah. There is no like You know, the first version Chuhao and I made in like three hours and then the second one I just worked on the past week or so. But it's also like I'm, you
01:23:17 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:23:19 Mario Elysian: know, Very, I'm the type of person it's like yeah. And At least in. You know, when I was in like architecture school, I've had way more critical feedback that is like, hit me to the core of like who I am. So I'm happy to happy to take all of it in. And like, you know, bring that discussion out to really understand what, like, how you, how you operate, like what your principles are and like, what you, what you want to like, you know, how you want
01:23:45 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:23:48 Mario Elysian: to own things.
01:23:49 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:23:49 Mario Elysian: so, Yeah.
01:23:50 Joshua Munsch: Cool. No, that sounds great. Just from like, I guess we are gonna go ahead.
01:23:53 Mario Elysian: So yeah, go ahead. Oh it's going to say I know we just have about a few few. How much do we have like half? Oh Half hour, right? Yeah, I mean maybe like I know we've talked a lot. I'm happy to answer more questions too, but if you also want to, you know, take this and digest it a little bit and we can kind of
01:24:14 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:24:14 Mario Elysian: think about like how you want to You know time this out like I you know we can we can also talk about that as well.
01:24:23 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, I mean I think that sounds good. You've give me a lot to think about and I Yeah, I think there's a level of I need to probably add a bit of definition or at least a little more constraint to it. And I'm happy to like share that too with you as I sort of like think through everything because yeah, a lot but it's
01:24:38 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah.
01:24:41 Joshua Munsch: incredibly exciting. the question I was going to ask you, I guess before we get into that is in this role like Correct from wrong. Is it like really trying to explore like we have this incredible underlying technology and it's like how How do we really make make use of that? And Like a end user form is that is that correct? Like you, the technology is that other companies right now?
01:25:11 Mario Elysian: Oh yeah.
01:25:11 Joshua Munsch: And on, like, kind of the product design side, or yeah, product. Development side from Tiny fish. Is it then also like you know, how do we bring this in our own form? Is that right?
01:25:25 Mario Elysian: I think maybe to let me think about the best way to Yeah, I think I think maybe the way to think about it right now is that like even though we're so very early company. We've been we've had some relative success working on like the pure like traditional enterprise methodology of going into like a sales meeting pitch deck. Having some discussions, somebody proves it on the company side we do a pilot program.
01:26:01 Mario Elysian: And then we, if they like what they see, they write a whole contract with a bunch of terms and we deliver it so to speak. You know, maybe more traditional to like, maybe how things went on with Palantir back in the day.
01:26:13 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
01:26:16 Mario Elysian: And it's like that's kind of like one way. And I think over the next few years, we want to remove our cells from that type of discussion. The kind of Sales and revenue oriented things will work for. You know, it'll work and it has the potential to be a very, very large company. I mean, look at Palantir. I think it's doing very well but the same time we want to. Yeah kind of think about like tiny fish being a Core interaction of the Internet and that really goes, far beyond the Yeah, the world of things but it's also like the intelligence that it has in the automation, it has can be exposed at various levels. So I'd say like the next realm that we're trying to go after is developers, I would say, You know or people like you. And I that you know if you want to use something like versa or 11 labs or stripe, that's like it's not too hard to integrate those types of things into your own to your own workflows. I think that that's probably like the type of platform that we want to think about next, where it's like, it's a little bit more. Self-service, you can at least sign up.
01:27:33 Mario Elysian: You can do some basic billing, Here's some API, Here's some other things. But if you also think about things like twilio, it's like the you know, they're they're core interaction of. You know text messages that they started off with is like expanded into like Well we kind of like handle anything that requires communication. It's like they
01:27:52 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:27:53 Mario Elysian: all have like send grid now which is the email automation thing and it's like they just you know, continue ballooning there, there realm kind of horizontally across all those things and I think that Yeah. Being that Internet type of service is actually quite interesting because it's like we kind of get to set and explore the the fringes of like where that realm is, where it's like okay we we can run the playbook of the enterprise thing and we we know that that's going to like have good traction and we know we'll have roots there forever because it's like most of these companies. Don't understand how that works anyway. And they they
01:28:33 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:28:34 Mario Elysian: Would rather work in that that fashion but then developers that want to like just like leverage this as an API. that's like one thing but then there's also just like How do we get developers to even like whether they want to use it for and it's also like and then there's also I guess companies that have end user products that will use tiny fish, either as like part of the front end interface or part of the front end slash backend connection or part of or it is the railroad that
01:28:59 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:29:02 Mario Elysian: the entire application runs on. So there are
01:29:04 Joshua Munsch: Got it.
01:29:08 Mario Elysian: Yeah, and then I guess it's like and then like the fourth one is like, is this just generally like an Internet service? Like for example, like I don't think I can send it to you yet, but maybe in a week we actually have like a full-on Claude integration that we're working on, where it's like, it's just naturally there as like another tool within Claude you can search or you can say, like use minnow and it will Go after doing whatever you need in cloud will like work collaboratively with it like any other tool. So it's like well, now minnows being used as like a primary tool inside an LM
01:29:50 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:29:51 Mario Elysian: Now, what and it's like in the LM can do whatever it wants thousands of times a day with it, if it wanted to or cloud code even so what is that realm? And so,
01:29:58 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:30:03 Mario Elysian: you know I kind of want to think about it, like Yeah, the core like you know, maybe traditional contracts, you know, developer community You know and user interactions and then like on the fringe like you know, who knows what like agentic as the user or something like that.
01:30:20 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:30:22 Mario Elysian: Or agents LMS as the primary user. It's like there are definitely like all these surface areas that we're exploring right now and to be honest like I think we just want to have like that horizontal coverage of like well the new Internet is this world. So therefore we want to have like entry points and like interaction points across that whole spectrum.
01:30:42 Joshua Munsch: Awesome. No, that's super exciting.
01:30:43 Mario Elysian: I think all that all that said is like we're still at like square one here where, where we have users that are just people and they're they're previous, they're only known concepts are Google and Chat gpt, so with. So it's like well from there like how do we
01:31:00 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:31:05 Mario Elysian: You know, start building that bridge to the next the next realm. So, you know, I
01:31:08 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:31:11 Mario Elysian: think that we, we want to invest some time in at least exposing a few of these publicly, to stir up the discussion of like, what's really possible?
01:31:19 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah. Well. Awesome. That's super helpful. To understand honestly because I wasn't
01:31:23 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:31:26 Joshua Munsch: It sounds like Yes, there's still there's a lot of it can be applied to a lot of contexts but hearing you talk about that. So with just one more layer of understanding with like current enterprise clients. Do you all basically Like build something custom for them, that's using the API. Is that sort of what happens?
01:31:48 Mario Elysian: yeah, I mean sometimes like there are customers that are just like They're technically knowledgeable enough. That it's like, Oh yeah, we'll just take your API and your your key and we'll just start using it and we build them.
01:31:58 Joshua Munsch: Got it. Yep.
01:32:02 Mario Elysian: And then there are others like, you know, I guess we've been doing that for a while because it's just like it's very low. Like yeah, it works and then there are others like the class pass one, where it's like, Oh we just want to at least have like a dashboard where we can just see how it went. And we don't want to build that so we'll build it for you. That was that kind of
01:32:22 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
01:32:23 Mario Elysian: one day project I showed you. And then there are others that are like, well, I think I have a lot of use cases for this at my company and I actually want to have like a little bit of a workbench. Tool that at least allows people of varying levels to start using this. And various types of automation. So now it's kind of like starting to become a little bit more user-oriented where it's like, Yeah, we have to guide them through like, what's capable, what's not capable. They don't understand how an API works, but they do understand how scheduling works. They understand how data table works. They know how to use Excel or something like that, or they use chat tpt all the time. So yeah, saving with within the enterprise thing. It's like, trying to expose those things is actually quite still like, Interesting realm. Yeah.
01:33:19 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. That's fascinating. And do most people get it like, The meeting gets set up. I don't know if there's, like the pitch or like people quickly understand, like, how I could take this API and use it.
01:33:38 Mario Elysian: Sometimes. Sorry, I'm just looking for a charger.
01:33:43 Joshua Munsch: No good.
01:33:44 Mario Elysian: I don't think I have a charger here, but I must have 15%. Okay, I think we'll be
01:33:49 Joshua Munsch: that's,
01:33:52 Mario Elysian: good. yeah, I think, you know, Yes. And no. I think they understand the core concept of how it Works. But I think we can do a lot better on illuminating the what the technology can really do. and I think that that's also like, just like a pure like Bandwidth. Problem of like, Well there's a lot of, a lot of discussions, we have a lot of
01:34:22 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:34:25 Mario Elysian: companies we have been, we just don't have the surface area to like you know spend enough time to like give them like the real deep dive pitch with like enough. You know. Specialization to like on helping them understand. It's like sometimes we only get like a half hour with them or
01:34:46 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:34:46 Mario Elysian: You know, etc where it's like Yeah how could we refine that better? That's absolutely kind of like a you know I think kind of with this something that's broad it's also like the how do you I think you're asking the right question of like How do you get somebody to like Understand this, as quickly as possible. Like, what is that? Minimum.
01:35:05 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. What do you think from what you've seen in the demos? Like, What do people
01:35:06 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:35:10 Joshua Munsch: immediately get for the most part? And then like, I don't know if you're able to generalize this or see a theme but like, what do people miss that? You wish Could be shown better.
01:35:21 Mario Elysian: Mmm. the thing, we always tend to focus on which I'll leave you to think about it is. We always have a bit of a challenge of showing the scale aspect of it. Like, Yeah, you know, you and I can understand like having a Searching for a car. with all these things and it's like, well you could probably go to like cargurus or carvana or whatever but it's like Think about like what is the fastest possible way to solve that problem?
01:36:06 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:36:06 Mario Elysian: Yeah, and it's like, we could actually spin up 100 browser simultaneously and go to every single possible site.
01:36:16 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:36:17 Mario Elysian: And answer that question. Of things, you've may have never. Even heard of. We may go to like random auction sites. We may go to like, we like, you know, we may
01:36:29 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:36:29 Mario Elysian: mow down every region in Craigslist and and figure out what's going on there and Facebook marketplace and like we may just yeah, start start going all sorts of is like how do you like even for like oh there's I guess a lot of different relationships and it kind of just depends on the company and the use case that we're talking to right now but it's like there's kind of like a one to or like I'm Like a one to many type of question. Like, for example, like our partnership with Google Hotels, one product manager, actually oversees like 8,000 of our tiny fish agents, like an entire like Yeah, 8,000 of them to go after different parts of, like, understanding hotel revenue for things that they can't find on Google or hotel like inventory and pricing, and things like that in Japan. So, it's like a kind of like a one to many and then there's kind of like the, I guess.
01:37:27 Mario Elysian: The class pass one. That's kind of the same. I guess there's kind of like the the one-off type of things where it's like, okay, like yeah, like a company wants to do these kind of like one-off transactions. Every once in a while and it's still useful to at least have like a unified service for this that they can like call up like I guess you could say like one point of information many many times.
01:37:53 Mario Elysian: Like kind of like a live API. They just want like just give me the price. Give
01:37:56 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:37:57 Mario Elysian: me the price. Give me the price. and then there's kind of, like, I guess you can call it like the distribution thing where it's like, Yeah, many people are doing it once but there's like a hundred million people doing it. On platform of a company. So, so it's also like,
01:38:18 Joshua Munsch: when you say that you mean like in an organization,
01:38:23 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah.
01:38:23 Joshua Munsch: Sorry, you don't scale not just from like how how it can spawn out and go do a bunch of different sessions but like the amount of people in your organization being able to then do that? Is that what you mean?
01:38:35 Mario Elysian: Right, right? And it's like, Oh, a bunch of people in the organization may do it. It's like, I guess when people think about skill, they think about it basically. And like those three ways, it's like, Oh, high volume, one transaction, high volume. Why just wide scale of problem? And I guess like many people using it, maybe lighter. Like low volume, all three of them. You know, could have the same amount of like total browser transactions but the way that it's utilizes,
01:39:09 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:39:09 Mario Elysian: different and it's like, and yeah we there are use cases that span like, you know, just get me the price of something to like, You know. Get me the insurance, quote inclusive of like the car, the My driver's license history, you know, all the all the available options, etc. And yeah, that's
01:39:32 Joshua Munsch: Yep.
01:39:37 Mario Elysian: also. In that realm. So yeah. So I think it's like I mean, maybe it's like kind of what are the
01:39:40 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:39:45 Mario Elysian: common things within that, of course. It like kind of all bottles back down to like, people want an outcome but it's like outcomes are you know quite variable and
01:40:00 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:40:00 Mario Elysian: sometimes simple sometimes complex and you know, Yeah. What are like the core principles that will allow us to kind of Scale that answer from like Okay. Yeah we can find you your your car to like we can power. All of carvana instead of like you know, and they can connect all sorts of dealerships etc instead of running their own system. There's There's a lot to dig in there of like at the end of the day somebody needs to
01:40:30 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:40:33 Mario Elysian: approve it and understand it and and find value from the technology.
01:40:39 Joshua Munsch: Yeah, got it. Okay. Nice, very cool.
01:40:45 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:40:46 Joshua Munsch: All right. Well yeah, let me, let me this, I'm super excited that I will say that. And yeah, like What time is it? Let me take some time to reflect on this. I'm curious to reaction reaction on
01:41:00 Mario Elysian: Please. Yeah.
01:41:04 Joshua Munsch: Because there's I feel like there's Obviously, multiple user groups. I think there's kind of just kind of consumer. there's also, these enterprise instances and in a way there is overlap but I also think there is When designing and experience again for the enterprise customer, there might be again certain nuances, you might emphasize in terms of like again what you do
01:41:26 Mario Elysian: All right.
01:41:28 Joshua Munsch: with this extracted information versus like the consumer. And so Thoughts on leaning into the consumer? Target customer. Is that? Sound reasonable or do you think? It's like, it should be applied to both.
01:41:47 Mario Elysian: No, I don't think it's unreasonable but I also wouldn't say it's going to be like it's own products. I mean it can actually I mean it can be but I would say like Even if it is like I guess, are you imagining like it's its own independent product? That's also fine. I would say like Why not for the sake of this exercise like Why not? You know There are definitely like also areas of consumer where it's like we may get a distribution agreement that it's integrated into a type of consumer product as well. So it's like I think both are Consumery. So to speak one of them know is like one sold directly by us. The
01:42:25 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:42:29 Mario Elysian: other one is like well we still have to convince and enterprise that it is worthy of integration so but I think both of them have
01:42:35 Joshua Munsch: Yep. Yeah.
01:42:40 Mario Elysian: I guess as I started thinking about this a little bit, both of them like the pitch would be seeing the end result to the end user so to speak. Right? So,
01:42:47 Joshua Munsch: Yeah.
01:42:49 Mario Elysian: yeah, but yeah, I think thinking about how and end user wants to bet Howie and
01:42:51 Joshua Munsch: Okay.
01:42:56 Mario Elysian: User can benefit from it is Worthwhile approach. Yeah.
01:43:01 Joshua Munsch: Awesome. Okay.
01:43:05 Mario Elysian: Cool.
01:43:06 Joshua Munsch: Cool. Well let me let me do some reflecting and I can just email you back. Like I said what you
01:43:12 Mario Elysian: Yes.
01:43:12 Joshua Munsch: Talk about at the beginning. Sounds good. I'll try and dig in around like,
01:43:17 Mario Elysian: Yeah.
01:43:17 Joshua Munsch: Six or so, and
01:43:20 Mario Elysian: And think about the Wii thing as well. Like, Did you have one when you were younger?
01:43:25 Joshua Munsch: Yeah. Yeah.
01:43:26 Mario Elysian: Maybe yeah you remember like picking up the nunchuck thing and like you know like I think that there's, you know. Yeah. Feel free to kind of Meditate on that a little bit as well.
01:43:37 Joshua Munsch: No, I think with that. Yeah. I was like kind of like when you hit that the screen like the Wii moment is like you pick that thing up and it's just like Well, like okay, I can see exactly where I'm going this thing and I think like
01:43:48 Mario Elysian: Yeah. Yeah.
01:43:50 Joshua Munsch: that metaphor of like bringing it into this experiences. Definitely be a guiding light, so
01:43:56 Mario Elysian: Awesome. Then yeah, should be an email. I'm you know, I have Date night with my wife tomorrow but Sunday, I'll be around to answer questions.
01:44:12 Mario Elysian: So feel free to reach out happy to yeah. Happy to chat a little bit.
01:44:13 Joshua Munsch: Okay. Awesome.
01:44:18 Mario Elysian: Cool. Or, Yeah. I mean, there's no like, you know, time limit. But, of course,
01:44:18 Joshua Munsch: Sweet. Mario.
01:44:23 Mario Elysian: you know, I'm sure we want to get to a conclusion as quickly as possible. So, you know, but just feel free to update me on how you, how you feel, like you're what's the most comfortable for your timing and we can go from there.
01:44:35 Joshua Munsch: Sweet. Okay. Sounds good.
01:44:36 Mario Elysian: Okay. Thanks for your time. This is great. I love chatting about this, it's good to hear your your thing you're thinking as well.
